Input N:
The user is prompted to input how many numbers they want to compare (N).
Initialize Variables:
MAX = 0: This is where the largest number will be stored. Initially, it's set to 0.
i = 1: A counter to track how many numbers have been input.
Loop:
The loop runs from 1 to N (while i <= N:), meaning it will execute exactly N times.
Inside the loop, the user inputs a number, and the program checks if this number is greater than the current value of MAX. If it is, MAX is updated to this new number.
Update Counter:
After checking each number, i is incremented by 1 to move to the next number.
Display Result:
Once the loop finishes, the program prints the largest number that was input.
This matches the logic in the flowchart and handles input, comparison, and output in a simple loop.
